Nike shoes are produced in Indonesia, China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan,
Philippines, and Malaysia.
Nike does not have any factories to produce shoes located in the U.S so all of their shoes are
imported from these countries. This is the area in which Nike has a lot of controversy.
Nike has still remained at the top of the industry controlling 33 percent of global athletic footwear
sales and 36 percent in the United States
In the 1990s Nike was heavily criticized by human rights and environmental organizations for
poor working conditions and low wages… At first Nike took a very hands-off approach and
refused to acknowledge the problems. They said the issues were not with their workers since
they contracted out their manufacturing and so Nike did not feel any responsibility towards
them.
Since Nike does not own any of the factories that produce their shoes, they do not tend to run
into any problems when having resources or shoes shipped. However, Nike has not made any
statement claiming they are a part of the Fair Trade Movement. One of the main reasons why
they are not is because of their long-lasting unethical treatment and payment of factory workers.
Nike has not fixed all of the problems in the factories. Another major issues currently is factory
workers wages. Workers that make Nike shoes are being paid well under the amount
considered fit for living a comfortable life and are working hours that exceed the law of hours
one can work a week.
The USAS is a group of students protesting outside Nike stores around the country. Workers
recently laid off at a factory in Honduras holding a rally to condemn the sportswear giant’s
treatment of employees. Activists in this group are organizing a “Global Call to Action Against
Nike” to draw attention to allegations of mass fainting, wage theft, and padlocked exits at
factories.
